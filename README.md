## Excel Data Preparation and Tableau Dashboard

### Excel Data Preparation

- Added a new calculated column in the Excel source file using a formula to classify or calculate key metrics (e.g., tenure segment, equality class).
- This step enhances data quality and readiness for visualization by providing meaningful categorizations directly in the source data.

### Tableau Dashboard

- Connected Tableau to the updated Excel file or database containing the processed data.
- Built visualizations that utilize the new calculated column to segment and analyze customer data effectively.
- Developed interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights for business decision-making.
